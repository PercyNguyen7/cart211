          Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
          South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
          exclaimed: "There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
          Captain that is lord over the On deck!"
        </p>
        <p>
          For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
          you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
          the levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose,
          and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: Thou hast
          outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware
          of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;
          beware of thyself, old man.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!"
          murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. "What's that he
          said&mdash;Ahab beware of Ahab&mdash;there's something there!" Then
          unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced
          to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his
          forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the
          deck.
