    <h2>My reflection week 4</h2>
    <p>
  The article was relatively hard to read as it constantly showers new reader with countless information and references regarding an art form from the past. I had some slight problems understanding the whole article.  <p>

  <p>  The beginning of net art seems to have a significant impact to the world simply by bringing people of the same interest around the globe together. That on its own is an achievement that not many can do, to unify a portion of the world’s population and gives them a platform to discuss. Furthermore, this innovative art movement allows users to communicate on equal footings without their any prejudices from their social status. A conversation between strangers must have been a lot more honest and truthful, for you can stay true to themself without the fear of being judged.  <p>

  <p>It is also intriguing how versatile net art can be from being a communication tool by the military to an art form for Eastern Europe to a place where net artists and enthusiasts can voice their positions and opinions. For instance, the VNS Matrix used the net as a medium to publish their work regarding the rights of women in their deemed sexist world. Their works are necessary to change society’s perception of women and net art provides them just the critical tool to tell their stories.  <p>

  <p>One of the more interesting information from the article is the King Cross Phone-In that allow strangers across the world to ring in any of the thirty-six phone booths in the train station. This in a sense reflects well the nature of net art – anarchic and chaotic yet fun and entertaining.</p>
