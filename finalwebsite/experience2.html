      <h2>Homelessness Composition</h2>
      <p class="p1 fade-in show-on-scroll">
        The problem worsens as the composition of homelessness changes and grows
        more diverse. Different from the past when older men compose the
        majority of the homeless, there has been an increase of homelessness
        among other groups of the population such as families, youth, Indigenous
        people, newcomers and members from the LGBTQ community in recent years.

        The reason why homelessness women and youth are less noticeable is
        because not all homeless are absolute homeless and must resort to the
        street. Homelessness can divided into four main categories:

      <h2>Causes of Homelessness</h2>
      <p class="fade-in show-on-scroll">
        According to “The State of Homelessness in Canada 2013”, a Homeless Hub
        research paper, homelessness is a result of three main causes:
        structural factors, system failures and individual and relational
        factors. Structural factors are financial and social issues that
        influence one’s community such as “the lack of adequate income, access
        to affordable housing and health supports and/or the experience of
        discrimination”. System failure ensues when policies and various systems
        such as healthcare institutions, corrections and child welfare fail to
        support the vulnerable population, leaving them exposed to homelessness.
        Individual and relational factors encompass all private situations that
        originate or are originated from homelessness. Unlike most stigmas and
        stereotypes views of homelessness, vagrancy is not always created by
        personal factors but numerous other social circumstances and systemic
        variables. Here are a few examples:

      <h2>Themes Among the Homeless</h2>
      <article>
        <p>In a study conducted by Dr.Ahajumobi from WaldenUniversity, fifteen Canadian participants of various
        backgrounds who were once homeless are interviewed to share their past experiences and their
        perspective about homelessness. The following theme emerged:</p>
      <br><br>
      <ol>
      <li> No Money, Home, Privacy, or Support</li>
      <li> Discrimination </li>
      <li> Mental Illness and Addiction</li>
      <li> Child Support, Credit Bureau and Criminal Records, and Housing Tax</li>
      <li> Inefficient and Discriminatory Government Support Systems as Well as
