  <h1 >About</h1>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <p>This site is designed from my own  interpretation of homelessness. It serves as an PSA to raise awareness about this present yet neglected issue. <br><br>

The website's design mirrors the life of the homeless after sunset. I imagine one of the toughest challenges for those without a shelter is the night, when one is deprived of the comfort of home. No lights, no privacy nor security. Exposed to bad weathers, dust, noise, cars and the cold glances of passersby. To be invisible to the public. To be uncertain of what happens next. <br><br>

The user must navigate through the dark to acquire information, similar to how a homeless seeks for a place of rest in the obscurity of the night.
